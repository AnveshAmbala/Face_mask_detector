## Introduction 👋

The Face Mask Detector project aims to identify whether a person in an image or a real-time video stream is wearing a face mask or not. It uses computer vision techniques and machine learning models to classify the presence of face masks.

## Features ✨

- Real-time face mask detection.
- Pre-trained model for quick deployment.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Customizable model training for specific requirements.
